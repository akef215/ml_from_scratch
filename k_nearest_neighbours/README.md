# K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) from Scratch

This folder contains a **from-scratch implementation of K Nearest Neighbours** using only `numpy`. The class provides two methods for fitting the model:

---

## Files

- `src/k_nearest_neighbours.py` : Python implementation of the `KNN` class.
- `docs/normal_equation_theory.tex` : LaTeX document explaining the mathematical derivation of the Normal Equation and ridge regularization.
- `docs/gradient_descent_theory.tex` : LaTeX document explaining the mathematical background of the Gradient Descent algorithm.
- `examples/demo.ipynb` : A Jupyter Notebook illustrating the use of the KNN class with visualizations and comparison with scikit-learn.
